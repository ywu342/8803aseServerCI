## Mobile
Currently, only the register screen is fully implemented.  However, the login screen should be similar enough to be trivial.

The button triggers an HTTP request to google.com (to be updated once the server endpoint is finalized), but getting the text from the fields of the form is demonstrated.  The server response is captured but not yet utilized.

The app can be run simply importing the directory mobile/PartyPlaylist as an Android Studio project.  It has been tested on a Nexus 5.
