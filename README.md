## Mobile
Currently, login and registration screens are implemented. If a user is registered then he can go to login page.

The register button triggers an HTTP request to google.com (to be updated once the server endpoint is finalized), but getting the text from the fields of the form is demonstrated.  The server response is captured but not yet utilized.

The app can be run simply importing the directory mobile/PartyPlaylist as an Android Studio project.  It has been tested on a Nexus 5.
